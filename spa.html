        <h3>Self care for mothers</h3>
        <p>Time is valuable for any busy mom. There never seems to be enough of it. And when you think about your priorities <br> making time for self-care probably falls near the bottom of your list below work, kids, home, and family. <br>
            But if you dont take time for yourself, you could be doing more harm than good.</p>
            
           <p><br> Stress, exhaustion, burnout, and even illness can take more of a toll when you arent getting what you need.<br>So whether you carve out a few minutes for yourself, or a whole day,<br>here are some ideas to get you started:</p>

    <ol>
<li>Try to increase in activity. Go out for daily walks</li>
<li>Pick up a new hobby that you enjoy, such as reading a new book or even crossword puzzles.</li>
<li>Pamper yourself. Run a bubble bath, splurge on your favourite skin care products or buy yourself flowers.</li>
<li>Find time for your loved ones and go out for a nice meal.</li>
<li>Hone your skills! Take up a drawing or pottery class or go back to playing your favourite sport.</li>

    </ol>
